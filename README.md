babyconnectR
============

* drop your csv files in data/
* run the baby.R script

# outputs
* hours.png - clusters show comparing start.ct (date and time) to start.hour (hour of the day)
* durationHour.png - comparison of start.hour and how long each feeding lasted
* durationStart.png - comparison of start.ct and how long each feeding lasted

For my son, only durationStart.png showed any patterns discernable visually.
